This is the repository for the `crabs dataset` from the `MASS` r package.

It uses a multivariate example data set of morphological  _measurements_ of two species of _Leptograpsus Crabs_ collected at Fremantle, W. Australia (see [Mahon 1974](https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/ZO9740417)).

Here is a brief description:

* 2 species of crabs (`B`, `0`)
* 5 phenotypica variables (`FL`,`RW`,`CL`,`CW`,`BD`)
* 200 unique index values per variable
* 1000 datapoints (each with a unique `observation`)

There are both `wide` and `long` formats versions of the measurements.

* `crabs_long.csv`
* `crabs_wide.csv`

The R code used to extract the information is in the `R` folder.
